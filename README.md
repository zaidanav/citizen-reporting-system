# Secure & Scalable Citizen Report System 🛡️
**Major Assignment IF4031 - Distributed Application Development**

This repository contains a Proof of Concept (PoC) implementation for a citizen reporting system based on **Microservices Architecture**. The system is designed to handle high concurrency, maintain reporter anonymity, and provide real-time monitoring to relevant agencies.

---

## 🏗️ Structure & Development Zones

This project uses a **Monorepo** approach. Code is separated based on functional responsibilities (Zones) to facilitate team collaboration without configuration conflicts.

## 🛠️ Division of Responsibilities (Roles)

To ensure development runs in parallel and efficiently, each directory has a primary "owner":

### 1. The Orchestrator (Infrastructure Zone)

* **Domain:** `infra/`, `docker-compose.yml`, `runner.ps1`
* **Focus:** Preparing the "ground" where the application runs. Managing Nginx (Gateway), Message Broker (RabbitMQ), Database, and Monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana). Ensuring all containers can communicate with each other.

### 2. Backend Core Engineer (Services Zone)

* **Domain:** `services/` (Auth & Report), `pkg/`
* **Focus:** Developing core business logic. Handling data validation, security, data storage to Database, and sending messages to the Queue.

### 3. Frontend & Integration Engineer (Client Zone)

* **Domain:** `client/`, `services/` (Notification)
* **Focus:** Building user interfaces (UI/UX) for citizens and agencies. Integrating backend APIs into the frontend and handling real-time updates (Notifications).

## 🚀 How to Run the Project (Quick Start)

Ensure the following are installed on your computer:

* **Docker Desktop** (Running)

### Using Task Runner (`runner.ps1`)

We provide a `runner.ps1` script to simplify container management without typing long Docker commands.

1. **Starting the System (Up)**
Start all infrastructure (DB, Queue, Services) in the background.
```powershell
.\runner.ps1 up
```

2. **Checking Status (Check)**
Ensure all containers are running healthily.
```powershell
.\runner.ps1 ps
```

3. **Viewing Logs (Debug)**
View activity logs from all services in real-time.
```powershell
.\runner.ps1 logs
```

4. **Stopping the System (Down)**
Stop and clean up containers.
```powershell
.\runner.ps1 down
```

5. **Restarting the System**
Restart all services and display access URLs & credentials.
```powershell
.\runner.ps1 restart
```

6. **Accessing Container Shell (Shortcut)** 🆕
Directly enter a container's terminal without looking up container IDs.
*Supported targets: `postgres` (or `db`), `mongo`, `rabbit` (or `mq`), `minio` (or `s3`), `grafana`.*
```powershell
# Example: Enter MongoDB shell
.\runner.ps1 shell mongo

# Example: Enter Postgres shell
.\runner.ps1 shell db
```

> **Note:** When running `up` or `restart`, the script will automatically print a table containing **Service URLs and Login Credentials** for your convenience.

## 💻 Tech Stack

* **Language:** Go (Golang)
* **Gateway:** Nginx
* **Message Broker:** RabbitMQ
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Relational), MongoDB (NoSQL)
* **Storage:** MinIO (S3 Compatible - Object Storage)
* **Monitoring:** Prometheus & Grafana

## 📝 Development Notes

* **Shared Packages:** If creating common functions (e.g., RabbitMQ connection), place them in the `pkg/` folder so they can be used by the *Report Service* and *Dispatcher Service* without code duplication.
* **Environment Variables:** Never upload `.env` files to Git. Use `.env.example` as a reference.
